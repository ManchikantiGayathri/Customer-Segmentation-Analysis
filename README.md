## Project Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on understanding customer behavior through segmentation. The process involves:
1.  **Data Collection:** Gathering raw customer data.
2.  **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and transforming features to prepare it for analysis.
3.  **Customer Segmentation:** Applying clustering algorithms (likely K-Means or similar, based on typical segmentation projects) to group customers into distinct segments.
4.  **Analysis of Segments:** Characterizing each customer segment based on their attributes.

The primary goal is to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized customer experiences.

## Dataset

The analysis uses the `ifood_df (1).csv` dataset. This dataset contains various customer attributes, including:
-   **Income:** Customer's household income.
-   **Kidhome:** Number of small children in the household.
-   **Teenhome:** Number of teenagers in the household.
-   **Recency:** Number of days since the last purchase.
-   **MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts, MntGoldProds:** Amount spent on various product categories.
-   **NumDealsPurchases, NumWebPurchases, NumCatalogPurchases, NumStorePurchases, NumWebVisitsMonth:** Number of purchases made through different channels.
-   **AcceptedCmp1, AcceptedCmp2, AcceptedCmp3, AcceptedCmp4, AcceptedCmp5:** Whether the customer accepted the offer in the last 5 campaigns.
-   **Response:** 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise.
-   **Age:** Customer's age.
-   **Customer_Days:** Number of days since the customer joined.
-   **Marital Status (Divorced, Married, Single, Together, Widow):** One-hot encoded marital status.
-   **Education (2n Cycle, Basic, Graduation, Master, PhD):** One-hot encoded education level.
-   **MntTotal:** Total amount spent on all products.
-   **MntRegularProds:** Amount spent on regular products.
-   **AcceptedCmpOverall:** Total number of campaigns accepted.

## Features

The key features utilized in this analysis include:
-   **Demographic features:** Income, Kidhome, Teenhome, Age, Marital Status, Education.
-   **Purchase behavior features:** Amounts spent on various product categories, number of purchases through different channels, and campaign acceptance rates.
These features are used to build a comprehensive view of each customer for effective segmentation.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need Python and several libraries.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git](https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git)
    cd customer-segmentation
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
    ```

## Usage

To execute the customer segmentation analysis:

1.  **Ensure you have the dataset:** Place the `ifood_df (1).csv` file in the root directory of the project.
2.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "2.Customer Segmentation Analysis.ipynb"
    ```
    This will open the Jupyter interface in your browser. You can then run all cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.
